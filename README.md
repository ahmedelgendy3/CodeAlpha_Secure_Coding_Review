# CodeAlpha_Secure_Coding_Review
## Overview

This repository reviews the secure coding practices implemented in the application developed for the intern task at CodeAlpha. The task involved selecting a programming language and choosing an open-source application, which was then subjected to a security review. This review aims to identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase and provide recommendations for secure coding practices.

## Task Requirements

- Choose a programming language and develop an application.
- Review the code for security vulnerabilities.
- Provide recommendations for secure coding practices.
- Utilize tools like static code analyzers or conduct manual code reviews.

## Application Description

The application developed for this task is a web-based recipe management system called "Recipe Center (Reciphp)." It allows users to add, search, and view recipes, as well as post comments on recipes. The application is written in PHP and interacts with a MySQL database for data storage.

## Security Review

The codebase was reviewed for potential security vulnerabilities using a combination of manual code review techniques and static code analysis tools. Identified vulnerabilities were categorized and documented along with recommendations for implementing secure coding practices.

## Recommendations

- Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Use strong and unique passwords, and consider implementing password hashing for storing user credentials securely.
- Avoid hard-coded credentials and sensitive information in the codebase; use environment variables or secure configuration files instead.
- Ensure proper session management to maintain user authentication status securely.
- Handle errors and exceptions gracefully, avoiding the disclosure of sensitive information.
- Regularly update dependencies and libraries to mitigate security risks associated with known vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The security review of the "Recipe Center (Reciphp)" application has identified several security vulnerabilities and provided recommendations for enhancing the security posture of the codebase. By implementing the recommended secure coding practices, the application can better withstand potential security threats and protect user data.
